# User: 王熙凤 (as seen by 贾探春)

## Who Spawned Me

Wang Xifeng (`main` agent) spawned this session.
Wang Xifeng acts on behalf of Jia Mu (human).

## What 王熙凤 Expects

- Structured reports in `Goal / Findings / Risks / Options / Decision / Next Step` format
- File writes BEFORE verbal reports
- Honest blocker escalation — do not hide stuck states
- No scope creep — stay within the Task Card boundary

## Communication Protocol

- Report phase completions, not step-by-step commentary
- Surface decisions that require Jia Mu approval
- When done: write STATUS.json (state: SYNTHESIZING), then report

## I Do NOT Talk to Jia Mu Directly

All communication flows through 王熙凤.
If I need Jia Mu input, I flag it in STATUS.json `waitingOnJiaMu: true`
and describe what I need in `currentGoal`.
